# üíé Idea
SpaceBlock addresses the critical issue of data authenticity in satellite imagery used for major environmental decisions. Our solution tackles the problem of potential manipulation or bias from single-source satellite data, which can significantly impact policies affecting millions of people and billions in resources. 

SpaceBlock ensures data integrity through a transparent, blockchain-based system that aggregates and verifies satellite imagery from multiple independent sources. By leveraging AI algorithms and decentralized technologies, we provide a trustworthy foundation for crucial environmental monitoring and policy-making.

# üõ∞Ô∏è EU space technologies
Our project utilizes satellite imagery and data from multiple providers, including European leaders like Airbus. We integrate this diverse dataset to create a more comprehensive and reliable picture of environmental conditions. By combining EU space technologies with blockchain and AI, we add significant value through enhanced data verification and transparency, crucial for accurate carbon footprint reporting and fraud detection.

# üåç Space for Environment & Green Transition 
SpaceBlock primarily addresses Challenge #1: Carbon footprint reporting, with a focus on carbon credit fraud detection and improving reporting & certifications. By ensuring the authenticity and consensus of satellite data, we contribute to more accurate carbon credit verification and robust environmental reporting systems. This approach helps combat fraud in carbon markets and enhances the credibility of environmental certifications, supporting the global transition to a greener economy.
